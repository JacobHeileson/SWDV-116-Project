    <h2>Hunting</h2>
    <p>
        No matter the game youre after, our ranch provides an unforgettable hunting experience across
        1,500 acres of diverse terrain. You can choose guided or unguided hunts based on your comfort level:
    </p>

    <h3>Guided Hunts</h3>
    <p>
        Work with an experienced guide who helps with tracking, field transportation, animal recovery, and optional
        meat processing.
    </p>

    <h3>Unguided Hunts</h3>
    <p>
        For independent hunters who want the freedom to explore the land on their own while still benefiting from safe,
        private property access.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>
        No matter which option you choose, every hunt is designed to respect the land, the wildlife, and ethical hunting
        practices.
        </strong>

    </p>

    <h3>Included Camping</h3>
    <p>
        Camping is free for all guests who book a hunting or fishing experience.

        access to clean water, restrooms, and designated fire pits.
        Whether you stay in a cozy lodge or sleep under the stars, the property gives you space, quiet, and the freedom
        to choose your perfect spot.
