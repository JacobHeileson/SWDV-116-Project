            How We Started
        </h2>
    <p>
        Jake's Outfitters was started by Jacob Heileson to give disabled and veteran hunters more opportunities.<br>
        In a high fence 1,500 acre ranch, owned and maintained by Jacob (and a few helping hands), you the hunter<br>
         will have the chance at world class game animals.<br>
    </p>
