    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Jake’s Outfitters combines the thrill of the outdoors with the
    comfort of a friendly, home-like environment. We welcome everyone — no matter their background —
    to experience our ranch to the fullest, in whatever way they choose.
</p>

    <h2>Jake's Story</h2>
<p>
    Jacob (Jake) Heileson grew up fishing with his dad and brother, and was introduced to hunting by a family friend when he was 14.<br>
    Although his disability hindered his oppurtunity a little bit, he was ultimately shown that it is possible.<br>
    From that moment, he was hooked. He began buying his own gear, and hunting with friends and his brother. But Jake wanted to do things on his own.<br>
    He would research day in and day out about hunting different game animals until he knew everything there was to know about them.<br>
    He tried baiting for bears, and tried a back-country deer hunt. Though, it was unsucessful, and very taxing on him.<br>
    Thats when the dream began: A ranch that gave disabled outdoorsman more oppurtunity.<br>
</p>

    <h2>The Ranch</h2>
<p>
The ranch sits on 1,500 acres of some of the most beautiful and fruitful land in eastern Idaho.<br>
It’s home to thriving populations of elk, deer, and other native wildlife. We take pride in responsible<br>
land management and ethical hunting practices that keep the ecosystem healthy for generations to come.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Hunters and guests can stay in one of our cozy log cabins or camp anywhere on the property beneath a sky full of stars.<br>
From the first bugle at sunrise to the last crackle of the campfire, every moment here reminds you what the outdoors is truly about.
</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>
    Our mission is to redefine what guided hunting means — not just as a sport, but as an experience of freedom, connection, and respect for the land.<br>
     We’re committed to providing accessible opportunities, honest guidance, and a community built on integrity. That’s our promise to every guest who steps onto our ranch.
